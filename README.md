This is a demonstration of using the dalekjs framework to log into a site and interact with an internal page.

It is configured to run every hour.
 
If you want to test it yourself:

*    put your credentials in the credentials.js file
*    run `sudo npm install dalek-cli -g`
*    then `sudo npm install forever -g`
*    then `forever start maintain_connection.js`
